# Voronoi Wallpaper Service

This document details the `VoronoiWallpaperService` class, the core component of the Voronoi Wallpaper Android app. This class is responsible for generating and rendering dynamic Voronoi diagrams as a live wallpaper.

## Overview

The `VoronoiWallpaperService` class, extending `android.service.wallpaper.WallpaperService`, provides the foundation for a live wallpaper. It orchestrates the creation of moving Voronoi diagrams by:

1. **Managing Control Points:** It handles a set of control points that determine the shape and color of the Voronoi cells.
2. **Generating Voronoi Diagrams:** It calculates the Voronoi diagram based on the positions of these points.
3. **Rendering:** It draws the diagram onto the screen as a live wallpaper.
4. **Animation:** It animates the movement of the control points to produce a constantly evolving display.
5. **Performance Optimization**: It implements several optimizations, including pixel-stepping, spatial grid calculations, and double-buffering, to keep the app running smooth.
6. **Adaptive Color**: It generates colors that are automatically adjusted for constrast, and randomizes them to avoid patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. `VoronoiEngine` (Inner Class)

This inner class, which extends `Engine`, is the main workhorse. Each instance of `VoronoiEngine` represents a single instance of the live wallpaper on a device. The engine is responsible for the rendering loop and manages the lifecycle of the wallpaper.

### 2. Coroutine Management

- **`wallpaperScope`:** A `CoroutineScope` tied to the engine's lifecycle. It ensures that all coroutines are cancelled when the engine is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.
- **`producerJob`:** A coroutine job that handles the generation of Voronoi frames.
- **`consumerJob`:** A coroutine job that handles the rendering of generated frames to the screen.
- **`frameChannel`:** A `Channel` that acts as a double-buffered queue for passing completed frames from the producer to the consumer.
- **`pointsMutex`**: Mutex to prevent concurrent modification of the `points` array, as it is used by both the main UI thread and the rendering thread.
- **`bufferMutex`**: Mutex to prevent concurrent access to the `framePool`, which are the frame buffers.

### 3. Point Management

- **`numPoints`:** The number of control points used to generate the Voronoi diagram.
- **`points`:** An `Array` of `PointF` objects, representing the control points.
- **`velocities`:** An `Array` of `PointF` objects, determining the movement of the points.
- **`colors`**: An `IntArray` holding the color for each Voronoi cell.
- **`pointColors`**: An `IntArray` holding the color for each Voronoi control point.
- **`initializePoints()`:** Initializes the positions and velocities of the points, as well as the generated colors for cells and points.
- **`updatePoints()`:** Updates the position of the points based on their velocities, bouncing them off the edges of the screen.

### 4. Color Generation

- **`generateDistinctColors()`:** This crucial method creates a set of distinct colors for each Voronoi cell. It uses a hue-shifting algorithm based on the golden angle to generate a visually pleasing distribution of colors. It then shuffles the generated colors to avoid having similar colors next to each other. Finally it generates the points colors based on the cell colors.
- **`isDarkColor()`, `lightenColor()`, `darkenColor()`:** Helper functions that make it possible to automatically contrast each point with its cell by making it slightly lighter or darker.
- `DARK_THRESHOLD`, `LIGHTEN_FACTOR` and `DARKEN_FACTOR`: Configuration parameters for the adaptive color generation.

### 5. Rendering

- **Double Buffering:** The app utilizes two `Bitmap` objects (`framePool`) for double buffering. While one is being drawn to the screen, the other is being updated with the next frame. This helps prevent flicker.
- **`frameBufferRect`, `screenRect`:** These Rect objects specify the drawing area in the frame buffers and on the screen.
- **`bufferPixels`:** A buffer that holds all the pixels of the frame buffer. It is used to efficiently write the colors of the Voronoi diagram.
- **`drawVoronoiToBuffer()`:** Generates the Voronoi diagram and draws it to the off-screen bitmap using pixel-stepping.
- **`renderFrame()`:** Takes the completed frame from the frame channel and renders it to the actual screen, doing any needed upscale.
- **`drawPointsToCanvas()`**: Draws the points on top of the generated Voronoi diagram in the screen canvas.
- **`pixelStep`:** A value that determines the resolution of the Voronoi diagram calculation. Higher values mean less precise calculation but higher performance.
- **`gridFactor`**, **`gridSize`**, **`gridWidth`**, **`gridHeight`**, **`grid`**: These variables define the spatial grid optimization data.
- **`useSpatialGrid`**: Config parameter to indicate if we should use the spatial grid optimization.

### 6. Spatial Grid Optimization

- **`gridSize`, `gridWidth`, `gridHeight`:** These control the dimensions of the spatial grid, which divides the screen into smaller cells.
- **`grid`:** A 2D array of lists, where each cell in the grid contains a list of the indices of the points within that cell.
- **`updateGrid()`:** Populates the spatial grid based on the current positions of the points.
- **`findClosestPointIndex()`:** By first finding the cell, this method can look only in the vicinity of that cell, allowing it to process the closest point faster.

### 7. Lifecycle Management

- **`onSurfaceChanged()`:** Called when the screen dimensions change. This method initializes the `framePool` and related objects.
- **`onVisibilityChanged()`:** Called when the wallpaper becomes visible or hidden. It starts or stops the frame generation and rendering processes.
- **`onSurfaceDestroyed()`:** Called when the wallpaper surface is destroyed. It cancels all coroutines.
- **`onDestroy()`:** Called when the wallpaper service is destroyed. It performs final cleanup.

### 8. User Interaction

- **`onTouchEvent()`:** Handles touch events. A triple tap pauses or resumes the animation.
- **`tapTimestamps`, `tapWindow`, `maxTaps`**: Variables used to implement the triple-tap logic.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization:** When the wallpaper becomes visible, `onVisibilityChanged()` starts the animation loop.
2. **Frame Generation (Producer):** The `producerJob` coroutine continuously calls `generateFrame()`.
    - `updatePoints()` moves the control points.
    - `drawVoronoiToBuffer()` creates a new frame by calculating the Voronoi diagram.
    - The frame is sent to the `frameChannel`.
3. **Frame Rendering (Consumer):** The `consumerJob` coroutine continuously receives frames from the `frameChannel` and calls `renderFrame()`.
    - `renderFrame()` renders the frame to the screen.
4. **Cleanup:** When the wallpaper is no longer visible or is destroyed, coroutines are canceled and resources are freed.

## Optimizations

- **Coroutines:** Coroutines are used for concurrent frame generation and rendering, ensuring smooth operation without blocking the main thread.
- **Double Buffering:** Prevents flickering.
- **Pixel Stepping:** Reduces the number of calculations needed to generate a frame.
- **Spatial Grid:** Significantly speeds up the search for the closest point.
- **Golden Angle Color Generation**: Colors are spread uniformly around the color wheel.
- **Color shuffle**: Avoid similar colors being next to each other.
- **Adaptive Point Color**: The points are automatically lightened or darkened based on their cell color, so they are always visible.

## Customization

- **`numPoints`:** More points create a denser diagram.
- **`pixelStep`:** Higher values reduce quality but increase performance.
- **`frameDelay`:** Controls the target frame rate.
- `DARK_THRESHOLD`, `LIGHTEN_FACTOR` and `DARKEN_FACTOR`: Control the adaptive color generation.
- `gridFactor`: Controls how many pixels are in each grid cell.

## Conclusion

The `VoronoiWallpaperService` class provides a highly optimized, visually engaging live wallpaper experience by combining effective algorithms, concurrency techniques, and careful resource management.
